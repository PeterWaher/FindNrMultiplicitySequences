# FindNrMultiplicitySequences

This project contains a small C# application that uses available processors, a large internal memory cache and [BigInteger](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.numerics.biginteger(v=vs.100).aspx) to compute how many multiplicity sequences there are for any given sum of multiplicities in the sequence.

I've put some results in the [Results](https://github.com/PeterWaher/FindNrMultiplicitySequences/tree/master/Results) folder. Here you can find the number of multiplicity sequences there are, for all multiplicity sequences with a multiplicity sum up to and including 10'000. (There are 36167251325636293988820471890953695495016030339315650422081868605887952568754066420592310556052906916435144 multiplicity sequences having a multiplicity sum of 10'000).

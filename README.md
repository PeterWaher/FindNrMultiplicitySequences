# FindNrMultiplicitySequences

This project contains a small C# application that uses available processors, a large internal memory cache and [BigInteger](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.numerics.biginteger(v=vs.100).aspx) to compute how many multiplicity sequences there are for any given sum of multiplicities in the sequence.
